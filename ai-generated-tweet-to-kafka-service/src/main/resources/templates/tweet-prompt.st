For text field use a string including one or more of the keywords: {keywords}
For createdAt property use the date pattern "EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz yyyy". So you need to format the date with this pattern in the json
When you decided on the createdAt value in "EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz yyyy" format also check the Day Of Week with the real day of the week for the specified year and month. If the day is not correct re-create the date in "EEE MMM dd HH:mm:ss zzz yyyy" format
In the previous answers you calculated the Day Of Week wrongly multiple times. Plesae double check that the day of week correct.
For example for 2024-01-02 you provided Monday, however it supposed to be Tuesday
For the timezone of createdAt property always use UTC
Please omit the ```json part in the response and any other explanation. So you need to remove ```json markdown from the start of json text and ``` from the end of json text
In the previous answers you still included ```json part. Check that multiple times that you don't include ```json markdown!
{format}
